# QA Engineer Technical Assessment Project

## Project Background
You will need to conduct comprehensive quality assurance testing on the shopping cart and settlement system of an online e - commerce platform (https://www.taobao.com/). The system includes the following core functions:
- User login and authentication
- Product browsing and search
- Shopping cart management (add/delete/modify quantity)
- Coupon and promotion code application
- Order settlement process
- Payment integration
- Order confirmation

## Project Requirements

### 1. Test Plan and Strategy
- Write a detailed test plan document.
- Define the test scope and boundaries.
- Identify test priorities and risk areas.
- Design test strategies (including functional testing, performance testing, security testing, etc.).
- Determine the required test environment and tools.

### 2. Test Case Design
- Write detailed test cases for all core functions.
- Include positive and negative test scenarios.
- Design boundary - value testing and handle abnormal situations.
- Consider different user roles and permission levels.
- Provide test data and expected results.

### 3. Performance Testing
- Design performance test scenarios (concurrent users, load testing, etc.).
- Use JMeter or other tools to implement basic performance testing.
- Define performance indicators and benchmarks.

### 4. Defect Report
- Create a standard defect report template.
- Record potential problems found during the testing process.
- Provide reproduction steps and environmental information.
- Classify defects by priority.

### 5. auto testing
- Create UI auto testing, you should at least test 1 part of that page
  
### 6. Test Report
- Summarize the test execution results.
- Provide test coverage analysis.
- Summarize the main findings and suggestions.
- Evaluate the overall quality of the system.


## Submission Requirements
